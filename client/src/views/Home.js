                            These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere. A park, an
                            unfinished basement or a garage can become a place to post your gains. Not just at a
                            traditional gym.
                            Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the
                            awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing.
