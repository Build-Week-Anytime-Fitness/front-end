## Front End Things to Do

[] hook up forms to back end API 

[] assign current user based on user id

[] enable full CRUD capability for editing classes 

[] implement a filter so when an instructor logs in, they will see only their classes (a conditional filter on classes component) … may require small refactor 

[] implement search by instructor feature within the Search helper function

[] Render response message after login.  May want to take it out of an alert and make it a cookie tag like I was showing you earlier on MAT ui so it persists for just a few seconds After it has moved on to the new view, and it doesn’t require a button click like an alert to clear it - STRETCH GOAL

[] Sign-up Form, Add sign up link / usehistory push to /login on
