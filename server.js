    bio: 'When it comes to iconic Japanese women artists, they don’t get much bigger than Kusama Yayoi, who is perhaps the most famous female artist working today. Most art lovers will be familiar with her polka-dotted pumpkins, which Kusama considers "the most humorous of vegetables"! Having spent her whole life battling with hallucinations, Kusama took to art to help deal with her internal struggles by putting them in a physical realm. Though almost 90 years old, Kusama is working as prolifically as ever; in fact she recently opened the Yayoi Kusama Museum in Shunjuku, Tokyo, which is so popular that you have to reserve tickets months in advance! Even if you don’t have a chance to visit Tokyo, you can probably find some works by this prolific artist somewhere near you!'

You want to try to make their world a little easier for them to live in.” At the beginning of the Black Lives Matter protests this year, Phillips says he could hear people marching by his Capitol Hill apartment. After spending weeks in quarantine under the stay-at-home order, he decided it was time to join the fight.Phillips was one of 16 local creatives who helped paint the phrase Black Lives Matter in vibrant patterns on East Pine Street. His letter was the “I,” which he chose to paint black, with tiny blobs of red, green, blue and yellow seeping in from the corners. Front and center of the monolithic “I” is his personal rallying cry: “For the Culture.”'

Specifically, his cunning use of brushes, airbrush, and spray cans serve as a means of bringing to life notable figures from the past, emphasizing their true dignified nature and beauty. Eduardo Kobra has also utilized a darker color palette in some of his works while maintaining that stunning air of beauty in throughout his work. You can’t help but feel a sense of nostalgia while looking at his creations, taking you back to a time when those individuals existed. The ability to recreate art that taps into individuals and eras past is a truly gift given to Kobra that is purely remarkable.'

    bio: 'Katch 1 has been drawing since he could hold a pencil. Art was something he always enjoyed. It was always a part of his life. Raised in Hawaii, Katch discovered his love for graffiti and for skateboarding as a pre-teen. Soon after his first spray painting experience, Katch’s neighbor helped him discover skateboarding. If Katch wasn’t drawing or writing, he found himself on his skateboard. After graduating from high school, Katch moved to San Francisco to immerse himself into the cutting edge Bay Area graffiti scene. When Katch got there, rather than painting, he skateboarded and immersed himself into the extremely progressive Bay Area DJ scene. As he watched the commercial graffiti industry swell and blow up in the early 1990s, he decided to move to Los Angeles in hopes of getting a job doing his passion: graffiti art. After weeks of sleeping on a friend’s couch and of unsuccessfully job-hunting at restaurants and stores, Katch 1 attended an action sports tradeshow in San Diego. He went in with just his black book and photos, and walked out with several job offers. From there, he worked for Conart, the first urban graffiti-based t-shirt company in Los Angeles. When Katch was living in L.A., he became fascinated with the freight trains that he passed by him everyday on the freeway. After painting a few trains, he heard that people saw and photographed his trains in locations as far as New Jersey and Toronto. Katch was immediately hooked. Instead of the more popular boxcars, he chose the “hopper” freights, which allowed Katch to paint whole car trains, complete with letters, backgrounds, and characters. In the early nineties, when Katch hopped over a fence to take pictures of his first complete whole car, JUST 195 of NASA / AWR / MSK / TATS CRU approached him.  The two immediately bonded, and through JUST 195, Katch was introduced to some of L.A.’s most notorious graffiti artists and he painted in some of L.A.’s most famous graffiti yards. Eventually, around 1994, Katch 1 and a friend started Natural Koncept, a small  skateboarding company which featured his artwork. In 2008, Katch released a 256 page self titled book featuring twenty years of his artwork. Mainly residing in Los Angeles, Katch traveled frequently back and forth from Hawaii. Eventually he moved permanently back to Hawaii in 2010 to raise his family. He currently resides in Honolulu. Katch still draws all the artwork and does filming and editing of Natural Koncept’s skateboard videos. He also paint murals, skateboards, freelances, and works at Banzai Tattoo Shop in Pearl City as a full-time tattoo artist.'
